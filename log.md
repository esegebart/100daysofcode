# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Went over the basics of classes again. Created a separate class from main, created fields that describe the state of the object with the private access modifier, and created two basic getter and setters that would get the model of the car from main and print it out and set the model of the car. Went over the "this" keyword and that when you put the dot to attach it to it, it shows locks for private or not, an m for method and f for field or p for parameter. That way you know if you are describing the parameter that is passed into the method or accessing the field through the modifier. Classes are real world objects, with fields that describe the state of them, and methods to make it do something.

**Thoughts:** I remember a lot of this, but it was really nice to go over again the modifiers, the this keyword, and learned a new trick that intellij helps us with using the little m, p, and f to know what you are accepting. I feel good about class basics.
